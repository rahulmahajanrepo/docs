Form Engine Designer - Architecture Documentation
1. Introduction
The Form Engine Designer is a React application that allows users to visually create, edit, and manage complex forms with advanced validation, conditional logic, and dynamic behaviors. This document outlines the architecture, component relationships, state management approaches, and data flow within the application.

2. High-Level Architecture
The application follows a component-based architecture with centralized state management and a clear separation of concerns between the form engine core and the designer interface.

        |                          |
        +--------------------------+

+-----------------------------+

5.2 Data Flow Explanation
User Interactions:

User drags a component from the toolbox to the canvas
User selects a component on the canvas
User modifies properties in the properties panel
State Updates:

Actions are dispatched through context
Reducers process actions and update state
Components re-render with new state
Form Schema Updates:

Schema is updated when components are added, removed, or modified
Schema changes trigger re-rendering of the form preview
History is updated for undo/redo functionality
6. Custom Hooks Implementation
The application leverages custom hooks for reusable logic:

Other key hooks include:

7. Form Rendering System
7.1 Form Engine Core
The form engine core is responsible for:

Interpreting the form schema
Rendering appropriate components
Handling validation
Managing form state

9. Validation and Form Logic
Validation is implemented using:

JSON schema validation for structure
Custom validators for business rules
Real-time validation during design and runtime

9.1 Validation Flow
Input → Validator Chain → Error Collection → UI Feedback

10. Conclusion and Best Practices
Architecture Best Practices:
Single Source of Truth: Form schema is the single source of truth
Component Isolation: Components are designed to be reusable and isolated
Unidirectional Data Flow: State flows down, actions flow up
Separation of Concerns: Clear boundaries between designer, engine, and UI
Recommended Development Approach:
Extend components by adding to the component registry
Implement new validators by extending the validation system
Use the context API for shared state
Implement custom hooks for reusable logic

This architecture enables a flexible, maintainable, and extensible form designer system that can accommodate complex form requirements while providing an intuitive design experience.
