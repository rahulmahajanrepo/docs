Architecture Decision Record: Migrating from Angular to React for Large-Scale SPA Development
Status
Accepted

Context
Our development team has been using Angular for several years to develop our single-page applications. As we plan for future large-scale web applications, we've conducted a thorough evaluation of our technology stack to ensure we're using the most appropriate tools for our needs. This ADR documents the decision-making process and rationale for migrating from Angular to React.

Decision Drivers
Developer productivity and learning curve
Application performance
Flexibility and adaptability
Community support and ecosystem
Maintenance overhead
State management solutions
HTTP client capabilities
Decision
We will migrate from Angular to React for our front-end development, using Recoil for state management and Axios for HTTP requests.

Detailed Rationale
Framework Comparison: React vs Angular
Component Architecture
Angular:

Comprehensive framework with built-in solutions
Follows MVC/MVVM pattern
Uses two-way data binding
Template-oriented approach with complex directives
React:

Library focused on UI components
Uses one-way data flow
JSX combines UI and logic in one file
More declarative approach
Learning Curve and Development Experience
Angular:

Steeper learning curve due to TypeScript requirement and comprehensive framework concepts
More opinionated, requiring adherence to specific patterns
CLI tools provide strong scaffolding but less flexibility
React:

Gentler learning curve focusing on JavaScript fundamentals
More flexible with fewer opinions on application structure
Easier for new developers to become productive quickly
Broader job market with React skills
Performance
Angular:

Change detection can be complex and sometimes less efficient
Larger bundle size due to comprehensive framework
Ahead-of-Time compilation improves initial load time
React:

Virtual DOM offers efficient updates and rendering
Smaller core library size leads to faster initial loads
Concurrent mode and fiber architecture enhance user experience
Better performance for frequent UI updates
Ecosystem and Community
Angular:

Backed by Google
More prescriptive, with official libraries
Smaller but more consistent ecosystem
Less frequent major version changes recently
React:

Backed by Facebook/Meta
Larger community with more third-party libraries
More frequent innovations and community contributions
More flexible integration with other libraries
Flexibility
Angular:

Full-featured framework requiring use of its ecosystem
Harder to integrate with non-Angular libraries
Better suited for teams needing structure and guidelines
React:

Focused on UI layer with freedom to choose complementary libraries
Easier to adopt incrementally
More adaptable to changing requirements
Better for teams valuing flexibility
State Management: Recoil vs Angular Services/NgRx
Angular State Management:

Services with RxJS for simple state
NgRx (Redux pattern) for complex applications
Steep learning curve with RxJS and Redux concepts
More boilerplate code required
React with Recoil:

Modern React-specific state management
Simpler API than Redux alternatives
Atom-based approach reduces boilerplate
Better performance with fine-grained updates
Easier code splitting and lazy loading
HTTP Clients: Axios vs Angular HttpClient
Angular HttpClient:

Tightly integrated with Angular
RxJS-based with Observable returns
Good TypeScript integration
Limited to Angular applications
Axios:

Framework-agnostic with promise-based API
Better error handling
Request/response interceptors
Wider browser support
Consistent API across environments (browser/Node.js)
Simpler syntax and less verbose than RxJS for HTTP calls
Benefits of Migration to React
Improved Developer Productivity:

Simpler component model speeds up development
Lower learning curve for new team members
More natural for JavaScript developers
Larger talent pool to hire from
Enhanced Performance:

Virtual DOM provides more efficient updates
Smaller bundle sizes for faster loading
Better rendering optimization
Greater Flexibility:

Freedom to choose best-of-breed libraries
Easier integration with third-party tools
More adaptable to changing requirements
Simplified State Management:

Recoil offers simpler mental model than NgRx/RxJS
Less boilerplate code than Redux patterns
Better performance through fine-grained updates
Better Developer Experience:

More intuitive debugging with React DevTools
Hot reloading maintains state during development
Functional approach leads to more predictable code
Migration Strategy
Training: Upskill Angular developers with focused React training
Pilot Project: Start with a smaller project to gain experience
Incremental Adoption: Build new features in React while maintaining Angular code
Gradual Migration: Replace Angular components with React equivalents over time
Risks and Mitigation
Risk	Mitigation
Knowledge gap	Structured training program and pairing with React experts
Migration complexity	Incremental approach with clear interfaces between old and new code
Performance during transition	Careful architecture to minimize framework overhead
Resistance to change	Clear communication of benefits and developer involvement in decisions
Conclusion
While Angular has served us well, React offers significant advantages for our future development needs. The combination of improved developer productivity, better performance, and greater flexibility makes React with Recoil and Axios the right choice for our large-scale SPA development going forward. The migration will be managed incrementally to minimize disruption while maximizing the benefits of our new technology stack.
