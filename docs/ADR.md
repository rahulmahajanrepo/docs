# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

## 1. State Management with Recoil

### Context

The Form Engine application requires a state management solution to handle complex, interconnected state that's shared across multiple components. The state includes form configuration, selected items, form data, and UI state.

### Options Considered

1. **React Context + useReducer**
   - Pros: Built into React, simple for basic state
   - Cons: Can become unwieldy for complex state, doesn't scale well for fine-grained updates

2. **Redux**
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, predictable state updates, good DevTools
   - Cons: Verbose boilerplate, steep learning curve, less suitable for UI state

3. **MobX**
   - Pros: Less boilerplate than Redux, reactive approach
   - Cons: Less explicit state changes, can be harder to debug

4. **Recoil**
   - Pros: Atom-based model, fine-grained reactivity, works well with React's component model
   - Cons: Relatively newer, smaller ecosystem

### Decision

We chose **Recoil** as our state management solution based on:

1. **Fine-grained Reactivity**: Recoil's atom and selector model allows components to subscribe only to the state they need, minimizing re-renders.

2. **Modularity**: State can be broken down into independent atoms, making it easier to manage complex state without tight coupling.

3. **Asynchronous Support**: Recoil handles async data fetching elegantly through selectors.

4. **Developer Experience**: Recoil's API is React-like and intuitive, reducing the learning curve.

5. **Testing**: Recoil's modular approach makes it easier to mock and test state in isolation.

### Implementation Details

- **Atoms** for independent pieces of state (e.g., `formConfigState`, `selectedItemIdState`)
- **Selectors** for derived state (e.g., `selectedItemSelector`, `visibleSectionsState`)
- **Atom Families** for collections of related state (e.g., `fieldValueState`)

## 2. UI Component Library Selection

### Context

The Form Engine needs a comprehensive UI component library to provide a consistent, accessible, and visually appealing interface.

### Options Considered

1. **Material-UI (MUI)**
   - Pros: Comprehensive component set, good documentation, widely used, theming support
   - Cons: Opinionated design, can be heavy if not tree-shaken

2. **Ant Design**
   - Pros: Rich component library, enterprise-ready
   - Cons: Strong visual identity that may be harder to customize

3. **Chakra UI**
   - Pros: Accessible by default, composable, good theming
   - Cons: Less mature than some alternatives

4. **Custom Components**
   - Pros: Complete control over design and performance
   - Cons: Significant development effort, need to handle accessibility

### Decision

We chose **Material-UI (MUI)** based on:

1. **Component Completeness**: MUI provides all the components we need for the form builder, including grid layouts, form controls, and navigation.

2. **Customization**: MUI's theming system allows us to adapt the visual design while maintaining consistency.

3. **Maturity**: MUI is a mature library with strong community support and regular updates.

4. **Accessibility**: MUI components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines, ensuring good accessibility.

5. **Integration**: MUI integrates well with React and TypeScript, with good type definitions.

### Implementation Details

- Using MUI's Box, Paper, and Grid for layout
- Using MUI's Button, TextField, Select, etc. for form controls
- Customizing the theme for our specific visual needs
- Leveraging MUI's specialized components like DataGrid for complex data display

## 3. Drag and Drop Implementation

### Context

The Form Builder requires drag-and-drop functionality to create and organize form fields and sections.

### Options Considered

1. **react-dnd**
   - Pros: Mature, flexible, well-documented
   - Cons: More complex API, requires more boilerplate

2. **react-beautiful-dnd**
   - Pros: Excellent user experience, animation support
   - Cons: Limited to vertical and horizontal lists, not actively maintained

3. **@dnd-kit**
   - Pros: Modern API, modular, good performance, accessibility support
   - Cons: Newer library, smaller community

4. **HTML5 Drag and Drop API**
   - Pros: No dependencies, native browser support
   - Cons: Inconsistent browser support, more manual implementation required

### Decision

We chose **@dnd-kit** based on:

1. **Modern Architecture**: @dnd-kit has a clean, modern API that follows React best practices.

2. **Performance**: It's optimized for performance with minimal re-renders.

3. **Accessibility**: Built-in support for keyboard navigation and screen readers.

4. **Flexibility**: Supports both sorting and free-form placement.

5. **Customization**: Provides lower-level primitives that allow for custom UX.

### Implementation Details

- Using `DndContext` to provide drag-and-drop context
- Using `useDraggable` hook for draggable field types
- Using `useDroppable` hook for drop zones
- Implementing custom drop logic for different contexts

## 4. Design Pattern Selection

### Context

The Form Engine needs to support multiple rendering targets (MUI, vanilla HTML) and be extensible for future requirements.

### Options Considered

1. **Component Composition**
   - Pros: Simple, React-idiomatic
   - Cons: Limited flexibility for varying implementations

2. **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)**
   - Pros: Can abstract behavior, reusable logic
   - Cons: Wrapper hell, difficult to debug

3. **Render Props**
   - Pros: Flexible, good separation of concerns
   - Cons: Can lead to callback hell, less intuitive API

4. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Pros: Clear interface, good for varying implementations
   - Cons: More structure overhead

### Decision

We chose the **Adapter Pattern** combined with the **Factory Pattern** based on:

1. **Interface Clarity**: The adapter pattern provides a clear contract for field rendering implementations.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: Form definition is separate from rendering details.

3. **Extensibility**: New adapters can be added without changing existing code.

4. **Testability**: Adapters can be mocked or replaced for testing.

5. **Factory Pattern**: Centralized creation logic simplifies adapter management.

### Implementation Details

- `FormAdapter` interface defines the contract for rendering form fields
- `MuiAdapter` and `VanillaAdapter` provide concrete implementations
- `AdapterFactory` creates appropriate adapters based on configuration

## 5. Handling Form Validation

### Context

The Form Engine needs a robust validation system to enforce field constraints, section dependencies, and overall form validity.

### Options Considered

1. **Form Libraries (Formik, React Hook Form)**
   - Pros: Comprehensive validation, field management
   - Cons: May not fit our custom form model, potential lock-in

2. **Schema Validation (Yup, Zod)**
   - Pros: Declarative validation rules, type safety
   - Cons: Additional dependencies, may not cover all custom cases

3. **Custom Validation System**
   - Pros: Complete control, tailored to our needs
   - Cons: More development effort, need to handle all edge cases

### Decision

We chose a **Custom Validation System** based on:

1. **Specialized Needs**: Our form model with sections, dependencies, and visibility conditions has unique validation requirements.

2. **Integration**: Custom validation integrates seamlessly with our form state model.

3. **Performance**: We can optimize validation for our specific use cases.

4. **No Dependencies**: Reduces bundle size and avoids external library constraints.

5. **Flexibility**: We can evolve the validation system as requirements change.

### Implementation Details

- Multi-level validation: field, section, and form level
- Validation functions that return structured error objects
- Integration with the visibility condition system
- Clear error messaging and display
